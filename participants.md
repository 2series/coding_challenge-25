## Matt#8280 - Twitter Bot
Having enjoyed building Discord bots in Javascript, I have always wanted to experiment with building a twitter bot and #30DayProject 
seems like the ideal time. It should be an interesting project as I have never worked with the twitter API before. 
Im not 100% sure on the features yet, I will define that once I get to grips with the basics. Feel free to connect with me on 
Twitter/Linkedin, where I will likely document my journey alongside Discord!

## Brian(Brew)#9228 - Gatsby-Portfolio
I have been debating on creating a blog for a long time and decided I wanted to build it right into my portfolio.  My old portfolio used just html/css and javascript. In order to update it I decided to move it to gatsby so I could take advantage of react and some of the really nice things gatsby does for data and static pages

## jaijg#2202 - My Expenses
Simple Expense ***app with MERN stack*** to track our daily expenses. Having got some basic knowledge in ***REACT*** and Wanted to Learn ***NODEJS***, I guess this is a good time to learn and upgrade myself. I don't know much about the NODEJS and EXPRESS, so yet to decide the features, flow and look of the app!

## green_arrow#9809 - Github Timeline
API's and graphical representation of information are hallmarks of modern web applications. GitHub Timeline combines the two to create a visual history of a users GitHub activity.

The goal of GitHub Timeline is accept a GitHub user name and produce a timeline containing each repo and annotated with the repo names, the date they were created, and their descriptions. The timeline should be one that could be shared with a prospective employer. It should be easy to read and make effective use of color and typography.

Only public GitHub repos will be displayed.
