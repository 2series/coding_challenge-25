## Matt#8280 - Twitter Bot
Having enjoyed building Discord bots in Javascript, I have always wanted to experiment with building a twitter bot and #30DayProject 
seems like the ideal time. It should be an interesting project as I have never worked with the twitter API before. 
Im not 100% sure on the features yet, I will define that once I get to grips with the basics. Feel free to connect with me on 
Twitter/Linkedin, where I will likely document my journey alongside Discord!

## Brian(Brew)#9228 - Gatsby-Portfolio
I have been debating on creating a blog for a long time and decided I wanted to build it right into my portfolio.  My old portfolio used just html/css and javascript. In order to update it I decided to move it to gatsby so I could take advantage of react and some of the really nice things gatsby does for data and static pages

## kylsiu#9227 - Web Idle Game
I am a professional video game developer and wanted to figure out a way to incorporate the ZTM work with that. I generally work with Unity3D/C# on mobile platforms so wanted to create a JavaScript game for browsers instead. My idea is to have an idle game with a funny story - mostly because I hate idle games and want to see if I can figure out how to make one people would like and therefore understand the underlying reasons on why people play them.
