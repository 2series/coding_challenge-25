## Matt#8280 - Twitter Bot
Having enjoyed building Discord bots in Javascript, I have always wanted to experiment with building a twitter bot and #30DayProject 
seems like the ideal time. It should be an interesting project as I have never worked with the twitter API before. 
Im not 100% sure on the features yet, I will define that once I get to grips with the basics. Feel free to connect with me on 
Twitter/Linkedin, where I will likely document my journey alongside Discord!

## Brian(Brew)#9228 - Gatsby-Portfolio
I have been debating on creating a blog for a long time and decided I wanted to build it right into my portfolio.  My old portfolio used just html/css and javascript. In order to update it I decided to move it to gatsby so I could take advantage of react and some of the really nice things gatsby does for data and static pages

## rahulzura-desu#4431 - Blog
I have found that I keep going back to the things that I had learned earlier, and I have got knowledge gaps. So, in order to learn concepts more clearly, I am going to write about what I learn, in simple laguage, like a story as mentioned in Feynman's technique. Also, I want to make this in plain html, css, js, nodejs, as I've been wanting to brush up my basics.
